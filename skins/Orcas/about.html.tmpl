            <h3>Information</h3>
              <p>
                The weather station is a wireless Davis Vantage Pro2 with a solar
                radiation sensor located on Orcas Island in NW Washington State.
              </p>
              <p>
                The software that handles the data downloading and this
                website generation is
                <a href="http://www.weewx.com">'WeeWX'</a>, an
                experimental weather software system written in Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket which is
                configured as a static website and is publicly available
                at <a href="http://orcas-weather.jamimi.com">orcas-weather.jamimi.com</a>.

            <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                The Davis Vantage Pro2 was installed in September 2018. It replaced
                a wireless Vantage Pro that was installed in 2001, periodically upgraded
                and repaired over the years. It was out of service for three weeks for 
                a major upgrade in March 2015.
              </p>
              <p>
                During a computer upgrade, all pre-2014 data was lost due to lousy system
                administration skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                On 1 October 2015 the station was moved about 40 yards from its
                mount close to a house to a stand-along pole well
                away from buildings. While this makes for a more solid
                installation, the anemometer is a bit more shielded from the
                wind and the solar radiation sensor is shaded by trees for a
                few hours a day. The new VP2 is in the same location.
